lambda-web
=====

Introduction
-----
lambda-web is a relatively basic HTTP server written in the Haskell programming language.
I'm not trying to do anything particularly new, exciting and radical in the project, I'm
just working on my skills in writing genuinely useful Haskell software.

Installation and Setup
-----
lambda-web uses the Cabal build system so all dependencies should be sorted out automatically.

Documentation
-----
Haddock HTML documentation is included alongside the source code at dist/doc/lambda-web/lambda-web/index.html
